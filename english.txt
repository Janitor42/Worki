    My tastes:

I like listening to different types of music.
It depends on my mood.Sometimes I listen to classical music but sometimes I prefer rock or something like that.

As for books, I like listening to audiobooks, but not reading them,
I'm not sure, but it may be depends on  my free time.
If you want to read a book you need a quiet corner but if you want to listen to audiobook
you can do something else at that moment.

I think movies are art.
It's another ability to feel other people and their emotions on the screen.
I like watching interesting movies where the main plot is not divided into black and white

    My lifestyle:

In my live I believe in stability. If you do something for yourself every day, and that process make you better, it's a
right direction. Our brain is learning all our live, when we were young we're learning to eat and speak,
and we can do it now, because we do that so many times.
Now we're learning another things, but it's the same method.

If we talk about my lifestyle, I will answer next - You need to find balance between your body,
your mind and your feelings.
All things in this list are very important, and you must do everything for your progress.
